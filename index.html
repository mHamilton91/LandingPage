			<h2>I'm Martin Hamilton, a hardware and software engineer living in Arkansas,
			making a change and pursuing a career in Web Development.
			</h2>
			<br>
			<p id="introDescription">I received my Bachelors Degree in Computer Engineering in 2018 from the University of Arkansas where my main focus was working with FPGAs.
			During the last year at the UofA, I worked in the Smart Embedded Systems lab working with a number of technologies ranging from networking to 
			Elliptic Curve Encryption used to create a hardware wallet for bitcoin. I gained a lot of experience with Linux and cloud computing while working 
			at the UofA. After graduating, I began working for QuickFlex, Inc., a company that contracts with the goverment on ground breaking hardware and software
			designs. At QuickFlex, I was a software engineer/principal investigator working with FPGAs. After working with FPGAs for over two years, I realized
			I wanted something different and with a passion for design and web development and have decided to take my caeer path in that direction.

					<p id="tipCalcDes" class="descriptions">Tip Calculator<br><br>The tip calculator is a Javascript project that I found while exploring CodePen. 
					This project was one of the first that projects I did using Javascript after I had gained enough experience with HTML and CSS.
					It is a very simple web app that once takes the bill amount, a percentage rating based on a service rating, and the number of 
					people that the bill will be split between to calculate the proper tip.</p>

				<p id="lumiDes" class="descriptions">Product Landing Page: Lumi<br><br>The product landing page is a project that I did while following the 
				Free Code Camp projects at the end of the HTML/CSS section. The page features only HTML and CSS. I found the LUMI keyboard on Kickstarter 
				and decided to use this as my landing page since I could easily pull information that came directly from the Kickstarter campaign to fill 
				out the information for the product landing page.</p>

				<p id="drumKitDes" class="descriptions">Javascript Interactive Drum Kit<br><br>The interactive drum kit page was the first 30 Days of Javascript 
				project that I completed. The page is set up so that the user can either press the keyboard keys marked for each part of the drum or the user can 
				click on the buttons to play the corresponding drum sound. The original project didn't address the user being able to click on the buttons
				but I felt that it would allow the user more control and it added the ability to play the sounds on a smart phone or tablet.</p>

				friend's band to start on a personal project to work on my development skills. The website, currently, does not have any Javascript but there are plans 
				to add much more to the website as things move forward. This is the first website that I have worked on with a customer to both design the functionality 
				and design of the website.</p>
